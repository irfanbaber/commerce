    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Website development involves several stages, each crucial for creating a successful online presence:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> This stage involves defining the website's purpose, target audience, and key features. It includes conducting research, creating a sitemap, and outlining the content.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> In this stage, the visual elements of the website are created, including the layout, color scheme, and typography. Designers use tools like Adobe Photoshop or Sketch to create mockups and wireframes.</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Here, the website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developers bring the design to life, ensuring functionality, responsiveness, and accessibility across different devices and browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> This stage involves thorough testing of the website to identify and fix any bugs or issues. It includes functionality testing, usability testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Once the website is tested and approved, it is deployed to a web server and made accessible to the public. This stage may involve domain registration, hosting setup, and final optimizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> After the website is live, it requires ongoing maintenance to ensure it remains functional, secure, and up-to-date. This includes regular updates, backups, security checks, and performance monitoring.</li>
